Dumper is a static file generator for building simple read only web services. Think "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll or "Nanoc":http://nanoc.stoneship.org/ but for XML and JSON.

It's very early days at the moment, the current code is not much more than a demo. The vague plan involves:

* bundling commands for deploying changes
* versioning
* date based snapshots
* support for more output formats than JSON and XML
* support for more backends than just MySQL
* and some sort of post processing mechanism

h2. Trying Dumper

First you'll need a MySQL database. I've provided a simple table definition and some data to get you started.

<pre><code>cd tests
mysqladmin create dumper -u root
mysql dumper < people.sql -u root
</code></pre>

You'll need to install the requirements from the requirements.txt file manually at the moment. Then run the main dumper script like so:

<pre><code>
python ../dumper.py people.truck
</code></pre>

This should give you something like this output to the console:

<pre><code>[Created] people
[Created] people/1.json
[Created] people/1.xml
[Created] people/2.json
[Created] people/2.xml
[Created] people.json
[Created] people.xml</code></pre>
