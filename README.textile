Dumper is a static file generator for building simple read only web services. Think "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll or "Nanoc":http://nanoc.stoneship.org/ but for XML and JSON.

It's very early days at the moment, the current code is not much more than a demo. The vague plan involves:

* bundling commands for deploying changes
* build in web server
* versioning
* date based snapshots
* support for more output formats than JSON and XML
* support for more backends than just MySQL
* logging
* and some sort of post processing mechanism

h2. Trying Dumper

First you'll need a MySQL database. I've provided a simple table definition and some data to get you started. See the tests folder for an example sql file.

<pre><code>mysqladmin create dumper -u root
mysql dumper < people.sql -u root
</code></pre>

You can now install dumper using the provided setup.py file. This should install all the requirements. I'd recommend using virtualenv to sandbox your python environment.

<pre><code>python setup.py install</code></pre>

You should now have the dumper command line application available on your path. Dumper uses a configuration file to determine which backend to use. Using the example file from the tests directory like so:

<pre><code>dumper -c people.truck dump</code></pre>

This should give you something like this output to the console:

<pre><code>[Created] output/people
[Created] output/people/1.json
[Created] output/people/1.xml
[Created] output/people/2.json
[Created] output/people/2.xml
[Created] output/people.json
[Created] output/people.xml</code></pre>

Run <code>dumper help</code> for a full list of options.
